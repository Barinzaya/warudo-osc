# OSC Input for Warudo

Available on the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3006445377).

This very simple plugin adds a node which can receive OSC messages via UDP, and extract a value from them. This can be used in conjunction with any application that sends OSC messages over UDP, such as [TouchOSC](https://hexler.net/touchosc) or [my Remote Wheel Sender](https://github.com/Barinzaya/remote-wheel).

This can be used to allow node graphs to be set up that trigger any action within Warudo, including reading data from the message.
